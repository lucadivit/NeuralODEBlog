# NeuralODEBlog

## Description

This repository contains the code related to the article series [I ODE, You ODE and the Neural ODE](https://www.lucadivita.it/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-1/).

Its content is divided into different parts, each corresponding to an article in the series.

* The [**first part**](https://www.lucadivita.it/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-1/) covers derivatives, integrals, and ODEs.
* The [**second part**](https://www.lucadivita.it/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-2/) covers the analytical solution of ODEs.
* The [**third part**](https://www.lucadivita.it/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-3/) covers the numerical solutions of ODEs.
* The [**fourth part**](https://www.lucadivita.it/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-4/) and [**fifth part**]() cover NODE definition and an example.
